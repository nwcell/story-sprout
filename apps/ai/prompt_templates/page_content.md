## Instructions

Based on the book context and surrounding pages, generate text for the current page {{page.page_number}}. Your task is to:

{% if generation_type == "content" %}
1. **Create Page Content** that:
   - Contains ONLY the actual text that would appear on the page of a picture book
   - Uses age-appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure for 2-3 years
   - Is brief and concise - typically 1-3 short sentences
   - DOES NOT include any descriptions of illustrations, scenes, colors, or compositions
   - DOES NOT include any meta-commentary or explanations
   - MUST match the style of the existing pages in brevity and tone
   - Maintains a consistent voice with surrounding pages

2. **Flow Considerations**:
   - Ensure the content flows naturally from the previous page
   - Set up expectations for the next page
   - Maintain narrative momentum and pacing

3. **Engagement Factors**:
   - Incorporate dialogue where appropriate
   - Use sensory language to create vivid imagery
   - Include emotional elements to connect with young readers
   - Consider opportunities for humor, surprise, or discovery
{% else %}
1. **Create an Image Description** that:

   - Provides clear guidance for what should be illustrated
   - Includes key visual elements, characters, setting details, and mood

   - Aligns with age-appropriate visual storytelling for 2-3 years

2. **Visual Storytelling Considerations**:
   - Describe elements that extend beyond the text (show, don't tell)
   - Suggest visual cues that enhance the narrative
   - Consider the emotional tone that should be conveyed

3. **Technical Considerations**:
   - Include information about suggested composition (close-up, wide shot, etc.)
   - Describe character positions, expressions, and interactions
   - Note important colors, lighting, or style elements
   - Match the style and complexity of existing illustrations
{% endif %}
