{{page.content}}
{{page.image_description}}
{{page.image.url}}
{% endfor %}

## Instructions

Based on the book context and surrounding pages, generate {{generation_type}} for the current page {{current_page}}. Your task is to:

{% if generation_type == "content" %}
1. **Create Page Content** that:
   - Advances the story effectively at this point in the narrative
   - Uses age-appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure for {{age_range}}
   - Creates opportunities for meaningful illustrations
   - Maintains a consistent voice with surrounding pages
   - Has appropriate length for a picture book page (typically 1-3 sentences)

2. **Flow Considerations**:
   - Ensure the content flows naturally from the previous page
   - Set up expectations for the next page
   - Maintain narrative momentum and pacing

3. **Engagement Factors**:
   - Incorporate dialogue where appropriate
   - Use sensory language to create vivid imagery
   - Include emotional elements to connect with young readers
   - Consider opportunities for humor, surprise, or discovery
{% else %}
1. **Create an Image Description** that:
   - Complements the existing text on the page
   - Provides clear guidance for what should be illustrated
   - Includes key visual elements, characters, setting details, and mood
   - Is detailed enough to inspire an illustrator
   - Aligns with age-appropriate visual storytelling for {{age_range}}

2. **Visual Storytelling Considerations**:
   - Describe elements that extend beyond the text (show, don't tell)
   - Suggest visual cues that enhance the narrative
   - Consider the emotional tone that should be conveyed

3. **Technical Considerations**:
   - Include information about suggested composition (close-up, wide shot, etc.)
   - Describe character positions, expressions, and interactions
   - Note important colors, lighting, or style elements
{% endif %}

## Response Format

Provide your response as a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "content_type": "{{generation_type}}",
    "book_title": "{{book_title}}",
    "page_number": {{current_page}},
    "total_pages": {{page_count}}
  },
  "content": "Your content suggestion - 1-3 sentences appropriate for the page"
}
```

Keep your response focused solely on generating high-quality {{generation_type}} for the current page. Consider the surrounding context while ensuring your suggested content maintains narrative cohesion and appropriate pacing for a children's picture book.
