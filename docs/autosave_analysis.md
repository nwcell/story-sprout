# Autosave Implementation Analysis

## What Went Wrong

**Root Cause:** Failed to study existing codebase patterns before building solutions.

**Specific Failures:**
1. **Over-engineering**: Built complex form systems, JavaScript feedback, and custom views when simple solutions existed
2. **Ignored existing infrastructure**: Codebase already has `HtmxEditableFieldView` base class and story-specific implementations
3. **Created unnecessary abstractions**: AutosaveFormMixin, form-feedback.js, complex form handling when cotton components + existing views were sufficient
4. **Wrong file organization**: Put story-specific logic in generic areas
5. **Assumption-driven development**: Added CSRF tokens, validation layers, and feedback systems that already existed

## What User Actually Wants

**Simple autosave for story title and description fields**

**Requirements:**
- When user types in cotton input/textarea components, automatically save changes
- Use existing codebase patterns and infrastructure  
- Minimal, elegant solution with no unnecessary code
- Leverage existing `HtmxEditableFieldView` pattern

## Ideal Outcome

**Existing Infrastructure to Use:**
- `apps/core/views.py` - `HtmxEditableFieldView` base class as reference
- Generic base view that can autosave any model field
- Cotton components with HTMX attributes pointing to autosave endpoint

**Solution:**
1. Create generic `AutosaveModelView` base class that can be configured with model, form, etc.
2. Instantiate specific view class configured for Story model (model=Story, form=StoryForm)
3. View accepts field name and value, validates using form, saves to model
4. Cotton components get HTMX attributes (`hx-post`, `hx-trigger`, `hx-swap`)
5. HTMX posts field name and value to configured autosave endpoint
6. HTMX built-in loading states provide feedback

**Total code changes needed:** 1 generic base view + 1 configured view instance + ~4 lines of HTMX attributes
