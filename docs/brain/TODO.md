# Project TODO

This file tracks high-level tasks and future development goals for the Story Sprout project.

## Rules

- mark tasks as in progress while working on them.
- work on one task at a time
- treat nested tasks as standalone tasks (so don't work on all of the subtasks at once)
- if you are not 100% on the way to proceed, write add a question to the task, provide a space for a response & pause
