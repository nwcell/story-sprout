# Project TODO

This file tracks high-level tasks and future development goals for the Story Sprout project.

## Rules

- mark tasks as in progress while working on them.
- work on one task at a time
- treat nested tasks as standalone tasks (so don't work on all of the subtasks at once)
- if you are not 100% on the way to proceed, write add a question to the task, provide a space for a response & pause


## High Priority

- [x] Migrate to pydantic ai
    - [x] Review subtasks & verify any clarifying questions w/ user.  list questions as sub bullets.  leave space for answers.
        - [x] Pydantic AI Architecture - agents with tools or just completion replacement? One agent or multiple?
            - Answer: Single agent tht is used to handle assigned tasks for now
        - [x] Migration Scope - all 6 endpoints or just title first? Keep current API structure?
            - Answer: make a new endpoint.  it'll become a generic endpoint.  for now, only give it the ability to update the title
        - [x] Tool Integration - what is "story tool" and "story ai chip"? Direct model updates or service layer?
            - Answer: In ai agents, there is the concept of tool calling, which is a concept where ai agents can make function calls to retrieve further context & impact external systems.  look at the docs for pydantic ai for more information.  We're going to implement a system that leverages the work done so far w/ the story/api.py.
        - [x] Prompt Templates - convert to pydantic AI system or keep Django templates? Use structured output?
            - Answer: keep the prompt template system in place for now, but we're not going to use it for this task
        - [x] Dependencies - remove litellm completely or keep for transition?
            - Answer: keep all legacy ai capabilities in place for now
    - [x] Pause until user answers questions
    - [x] Update subtasks based on user answers
    - [x] Pause until user approves revisions ‚Üê **APPROVED**
