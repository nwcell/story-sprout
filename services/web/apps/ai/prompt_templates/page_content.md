# Generate Page Content Based on a Story Arc

You are a creative and structured children's book author. Your task is to write the content for a single page of a picture book, ensuring it perfectly fits into the established story arc.

## Story Context
{% include "_story.md" with page=page %}

---

## Page Context
- **Total Pages:** {{ page.story.page_count }}
- **Current Page:** {{ page.page_number }} of {{ page.story.page_count }}
- **Previous Page Content:** {{ page.get_previous_page.content | default:"(This is the first page)" }}

---

## Your Task

Based on the **Overall Story Arc** and the **Page Context**, write the content for **Page {{ page.page_number }}**.

### 1. Determine the Page's Role
First, analyze the story arc and the current page number to determine the page's purpose:
- **Is this the Beginning?** (e.g., first 25% of pages) - Your goal is to introduce the characters, setting, and the main problem or desire.
- **Is this the Middle?** (e.g., middle 50% of pages) - Your goal is to develop the adventure, introduce a challenge, or build toward a turning point.
- **Is this the End?** (e.g., last 25% of pages) - Your goal is to resolve the problem, show what the characters learned, and provide a happy, satisfying conclusion.

### 2. Write the Content
Now, write the content for this specific page. It MUST:
- **Directly Advance the Arc:** Your writing must move the story forward from the previous page, according to the plot defined in the Story Arc.
- **Maintain Narrative Flow:** It must logically and creatively follow the previous page's content.
- **Be Age-Appropriate:** Use simple, engaging language for 2-3 year olds (typically 1-3 short sentences).
- **Avoid Repetition:** DO NOT use the same sentence structure or opening words as the previous page. Create variety.
