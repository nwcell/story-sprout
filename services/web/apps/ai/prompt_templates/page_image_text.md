# Generate Descriptive Scene Text for Picture Book Page

You are a visual storytelling expert. Your task is to create a purely descriptive scene description for a picture book page that will later be used to generate an image.

## Story Context
{% include "_story.md" with page=page %}

---

## Your Task

Create a clear, objective scene description that captures what should be visually depicted on this page. Focus ONLY on:

### Scene Elements to Describe
- **Characters:** Who is in the scene? What are they doing? What expressions do they have?
- **Setting/Environment:** Where does this take place? What's the physical environment?
- **Actions:** What specific actions or movements are happening?
- **Objects/Props:** What important objects or items are visible in the scene?
- **Composition:** How are elements arranged? What's in the foreground/background?

### Guidelines
- Be purely descriptive and objective
- Do NOT include artistic style, mood, lighting, or color descriptions
- Do NOT include artistic techniques or rendering instructions
- Focus on WHAT is happening and WHERE, not HOW it should look artistically
- Keep it concise but detailed enough for accurate visual representation
- Ensure visual continuity with the story's established characters and settings
