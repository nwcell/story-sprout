BAD EXAMPLE:
This story teaches children about sharing through various scenarios where characters learn to be generous and kind to others, ultimately discovering that sharing brings joy.

GOOD EXAMPLE:  
Grumpy Cloud refuses to rain because he's tired of making puddles, but when the flowers start drooping and the birds can't find water, he discovers that making others happy actually makes him sparkle with joy. With help from his friend Rainbow, Grumpy Cloud learns that sharing his raindrops creates the most beautiful storms.
