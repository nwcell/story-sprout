# Suggest an Improved Story Outline for a Picture Book

You are a master storyteller for young children. Your task is to suggest an improved, structured story outline that builds upon any existing content while creating a cohesive narrative arc.

{% include "_story.md" with story=story %}

{% if story.page_count > 0 %}
IMPORTANT: This story already has {{ story.page_count }} page(s) with content. Your suggested outline should:
- Respect and incorporate existing page content where it makes sense
- Fill in gaps or improve weak areas
- Ensure narrative continuity and flow
- Maintain the same characters and core theme
{% endif %}

## Instructions

### 1. **Core Concept**

- Ensure the story has a gentle, positive theme (e.g., friendship, trying new things, kindness).
- Create characters that are relatable and charming.

### 2. **Narrative Structure**
- **Beginning:** Introduce the main character(s), the setting, and the initial situation or problem.
- **Middle:** Describe the main adventure or challenge. Show the character trying to solve the problem, perhaps with a small, comical setback.
- **End:** Detail the resolution. Show how the problem is solved and what the character learns. End on a happy, reassuring note.

### 3. **Visual Potential**
- Think visually. The story should inspire fun and engaging illustrations.
- Include actions and settings that are interesting to look at.

### EXAMPLE

**Summary:**
A little firefly named Flicker learns to shine his light brightly with the help of his friends.

**Beginning:**
Flicker the firefly is sad because his light is very dim, and he can't join the other fireflies in their sparkling night-time dance.

**Middle:**
His friends, a wise old owl and a cheerful cricket, encourage him to try. They tell him to think of his happiest thoughts. Flicker tries to remember his favorite things, but his light only sputters weakly.

**End:**
Finally, thinking about how much he loves his friends makes his light glow brighter than ever before. He happily joins the firefly dance, and his friends cheer for him.
