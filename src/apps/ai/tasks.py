        2. Get the current page information for page {page_obj.page_number}

        - Beginning (first 25% of pages): Introduce characters, setting, and main problem
        - Middle (middle 50% of pages): Develop adventure and build toward turning point
        - End (last 25% of pages): Resolve problem and provide happy conclusion
        4. Write content that:
        - Directly advances the story arc from previous page
        - Maintains narrative flow and logical progression
        - Uses simple, engaging language for 2-3 year olds (1-3 short sentences)
        - Avoids repetition of previous page structure

        Create and save a descriptive scene description for page {page_obj.page_number}

        3. Create a purely descriptive scene that captures what should be visually depicted
        4. Focus on these scene elements:\n
         - Characters: Who is in the scene? What are they doing? What expressions?
         - Setting/Environment: Where does this take place? Physical environment?
         - Actions: What specific actions or movements are happening?
         - Objects/Props: What important objects or items are visible?
         - Composition: How are elements arranged? Foreground/background?
        5. Guidelines:
         - Be purely descriptive and objective
         - Do NOT include artistic style, mood, lighting, or color descriptions
         - Focus on WHAT is happening and WHERE, not HOW it should look
         - Keep it concise but detailed for accurate visual representation

        6. IMPORTANT: Use the update_page tool with page_num={page_obj.page_number} and
        image_text set to your scene description
